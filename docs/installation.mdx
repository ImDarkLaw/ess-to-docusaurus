# Installation
This guide will walk you through the process of installing and updating EssentialsX, as well as, list the supported
server platforms and versions.

EssentialsX is split up into several separate plugins. The only jar that is necessary for EssentialsX to work is the
main EssentialsX jar, which contains most of the core features most servers will need. The other modules are optional -
see the modules category on the sidebar in the left-hand side for more information on what each module does.

Below are the steps you need to follow to start using the plugin:

### Step 1: Use a supported server platform and version
To fully leverage EssentialsX's feature, we recommend installing it on [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper). See
[here](#supported-server-versions-and-software) for further information on the supported server versions and software.

### Step 2: Download the EssentialsX jar file
The first thing you will need to do is download the core EssentialsX plugin. You can find the latest version of
EssentialsX on our [downloads page](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html).

### Step 3: Add the EssentialsX jar to your plugins folder
Once you've decided which EssentialsX modules you need, copy the required .jar files into the `plugins/` directory.

### Step 4: Restart your server
Once you've installed all the plugins you need, restart your server. EssentialsX will create configuration files
(and upgrade old Essentials data if needed) when it starts up.

:::tip
As your server restarts, you can monitor the console to make sure EssentialsX and any of its modules start up and enable
correctly.

### Step 5: That's it!
EssentialsX is now installed, and you can start using it right away! Move onto the [EssentialsX Core](modules/core)
page of the wiki on how to configure the plugin!

## Updating EssentialsX
Updating EssentialsX is extremely easy. Follow the suggested course of action below to ensure a smooth update process:

1. **Stop your server:** Before making any changes, it is recommended to stop your server to prevent any issues.

2. **Replace Jar Files:** Download the latest EssentialsX jar files from our
[downloads page](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html). Replace your old jar files with the new ones. Your
configuration files will remain unchanged.

### Updating Modules
Follow the steps outlined above replacing your old jars with the updated ones from the downloads page, ensuring all
modules match the version of the core EssentialsX plugin.

### Updating Configuration
To update the configuration, you can either generate a new one or use [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to
compare your existing config with the updated default one from [this link](https://git.io/JG4z1).

:::note Getting "unknown items" issues on newer versions?
If you're upgrading server versions, ensure you delete the `items.json` (or `items.csv`) file in
your Essentials folder while the server is stopped. Essentials will create an updated items.json file on startup.

## Supported Server Versions and Software

EssentialsX officially supports [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) (recommended) and [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) servers
running the following server versions:

- 1.20.4 and 1.19.4 - EssentialsX actively develops against and supports these versions.
- 1.8.8 â†’ 1.18.2 - these versions are still
supported, but are not a priority for us, and may be dropped in a future release.

:::danger EssentialsX does not support the following Minecraft versions and server software:

- [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) is not supported yet. Do not attempt to use current versions of
EssentialsX on Folia or forks of it - you may lose userdata.
- "Ultra-performance" Paper forks (Akarin, Yatopia, etc.). These often perform non-standard behavior and can break your
worlds and installed plugins.
- Forge/Bukkit hybrid servers including Mohist, Arclight, Magma, Cauldron, Thermos, CatServer, etc. EssentialsX is
built for the Bukkit API, which does not properly support mods.
- 1.7.10 or below.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What's the difference between Stable and Development builds? Which should I download?

A: Stable releases undergo extensive testing and are generally more reliable. They are recommended for production
environments. Development builds, on the other hand, contain the latest features and bug fixes and may have not been
heavily tested. They are best suited for users who want to try out new features and bug fixes or contribute to testing
and feedback.
